== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've just activated Soccer Info, what do I need to do now? =

You are now able to add the shortcodes that displays the tables (fixtures or results) to any of your posts or pages. 
For example: `[soccer-info id='1' type='table' /]`
That means you want to display the ranking `table` (type) of the soccer league with the id=1 (Spanish Primera Division)
You will find the whole list of the soccer leagues supported by the plugin on the `Settings` > `Soccer Info` page.

= I don't know how to use shortcodes, what should I do then? =

For your confort, we added a function to the post/page editor that automatically generates and inserts the shortcodes for you. You will be prompted to select the league (and some other info) and then just click `Insert`
It sounds easy. Isn't is?

= Does this plugin have a widget? =

Yes, and it's easy to use.

= I have a another question. Where can I ask that? =
